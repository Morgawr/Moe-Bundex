# Contributor Guidelines

We welcome all kinds of contributions, as long as they meet the guidelines
defined below. We try to hold a high standard of curation for all our sentences
and their translations, and we expect contributors to conform to the guidelines
below or their submissions will likely be rejected.

## General Guidelines

- All sentences must have an attributable source. This preferably would be the
  title of the work the sentence has been taken from. In case of works with
  multiple entries/volumes, having the exact volume or episode number is ideal
  but not required.
- All sentences must have a tag that describes the type of material they were
  taken from. There are works that share the same title across light novel,
  manga, and anime adaptations. Knowing which sentence comes from which material
  is fundamental to the health of this project.

## Japanese Sentences

- The sentence must be taken from native media. No translations from other
  sources, including official translations of books or games, etc. The original
  source must be in Japanese.
- Prioritize short and unambiguous sentences that exemplify the chosen word as
  much as possible.
- Avoid what could be reasonably considered a spoiler for someone reading the
  source material, pay special attention to major spoilers that reveal
  information like character identities, character deaths, big reveals, etc.
- Avoid sentences that could have multiple interpretations or that require
  awareness of the context they show up in. If the reviewer is not sure about
  the meaning of the sentence, it is not an acceptable sentence.
- Avoid sentences with in-universe specific words (exceptions can be made for
  character names). If the sentence refers to fictional places or uses
  terminology that does not exist in a normal dictionary, especially in kanji
  form, it is not a good sentence.
- Avoid sentences that contain weird speech quirks or have weird/unusual gobi or
  excessive slang as they are not good examples to learn from. An exception can
  be made if the word/expression being used in the sentence is part of a
  specific style or stereotyped language.
- Avoid sentences that have grammatical mistakes, intentional or not. For
  example, characters that speak with intentionally incorrect Japanese (example:
  Anya from Spy x Family). Slang usage of words are not grammar mistakes and can
  be accepted (example: すごい美味しい)
- Prioritize submitting sentences that are sourced from scripted content.
  Unprompted conversations or free-flow content (podcasts, livestreams, etc) are
  likely going to have less strict quality expectations. They might be more
  "realistic" but less useful as a curated example of the language.
- The submitted sentence should maintain the same furigana as in the original
  material, the submitter should not make changes to the furigana. Refer to the
  data format section in the [README](../README.md) on how to encode the
  furigana.

## English Translation

- Do not submit translations of sentences you don't fully understand. If you are
  not sure about the translation or interpretation, do not submit it.
- Prioritize "literal" translations over loose semantically equivalent
  translations (see example 5 below)
- Favor natural-sounding English sentences as much as possible, as long as the
  other guidelines are met. Awkward and syntactically broken/unnatural English
  translations are not acceptable unless the Japanese is slangy enough to
  warrant such use (must be justified/explained in the Notes field).
- The use of machine translation is heavily discouraged but not entirely banned,
  with the caveat that the translation must be vetted by the submitter who
  vouches for its accuracy and it fits the other submission guidelines. Do not
  mass translate and submit in bulk. Quality over quantity.
- When translating collocations and proverbs, prioritize keeping the Japanese
  meaning over the English if there is no equivalent proverb or the English
  equivalent significantly changes the literal meaning. If necessary, add an
  explanation in the Notes field.
- Translations don't need to conform to the same grammatical structure of the
  Japanese sentence but it would be nice if they could, while still being
  grammatically correct in English. Readers should be able to recognize which
  part of the English sentence maps to the equivalent Japanese.
- Favor adding pronouns and explicitly mark dropped subjects even when they
  aren't clear/specified in Japanese. For example: "He ate an apple" (good) vs
  "Ate an apple" (bad)
- Do not shoehorn Japanese-specific language quirks in the English translation
  (remove honorifics, it's okay to change <name>さん into "you", etc) unless
  absolutely necessary (in which case it should be mentioned in the Notes).
- Do not add or change details in the English translation that do not exist in
  the Japanese sentence without a good reason (which should be specified in the
  Notes).
- Prioritize in the translation the clear understanding of the single
  word/expression that the sentence is a submission for. Even if the rest of the
  sentence is not translated as clearly, the parallel with the submitted
  Japanese entry should be evident.

## Examples

### Example 1

Japanese: 星が空にきらきら輝いている。

**BAD** English: The stars are twinkling above.

Reason why it's bad:

- The Japanese says 空 (sky), the English says "above".

**GOOD** English: The stars are twinkling in the sky.

### Example 2

Japanese:「そのとおり」私は、シャワーを浴びている時に石鹸が目に入るとヒステリー状態になる男のように、娘のこの話に身震いしながら言った。

**BAD** English: Right, I said, shivering at this recital as a man would who
gets hysterical while taking a shower if a bit of soap stings his eye.

Reason why it's bad:

- The translation is weird.
- The Japanese sentence is unnecessarily long and complicated.
- Lots of unnecessary changes.
- It's hard to point out which part of the English sentence refers to which part
  in the Japanese.

It's hard to find a good version for this, just don't submit it.

### Example 3

Japanese: ジョーンは夫をさっさと見限って別れてしまった。

**BAD** English: Joan dropped her husband like a hot potato.

Reason why it's bad:

- "like a hot potato" is an unnecessary expression that doesn't reflect the
  Japanese well.
- "Dropped" instead of "broke up" or "left" is unnecessarily ambiguous and can
  have multiple meanings.

**GOOD** English: Joan immediately gave up on her husband and divorced him.

### Example 4

Japanese: 客は三々五々到着した。

**BAD** English: Guests arrived by twos and threes.

Reason why it's bad:

- While in English we could say "by twos and threes", in Japanese we say "by
  threes and fives" so on a first look, the translation seems to imply a
  different meaning from the Japanese.

**GOOD** English: The guests arrived in small groups of threes and fives.

- Notes: In Japanese 三々五々 ("threes and fives") is an approximation to imply
  small groups. A similar English collocation could be "by two and threes",
  albeit slightly uncommon.

### Example 5

Japanese: 彼はうれしさで我を忘れていた。

**BAD** English: He was beside himself with joy.

Reason why it's bad:

- While semantically the English translation is fine, it completely changes the
  structure of the Japanese sentence and makes it hard to follow which
  expression maps to which word.

**GOOD** English: He was so happy he was out of his mind

### Note for reviewers:

If you find a submission that successfully meets all the guidelines above but
you still consider it to not be acceptable, make a note and we should review the
process/add new guidelines if necessary. The set of guidelines listed above
should be exhaustive and complete enough to be able to always point to one of
those points being broken as a reason for rejecting a submission.

## Contribution Process

If you want to contribute a new sentence to the database, open a new forum post
in our submission section (TBD) following the contributor's template (TBD). Make
sure to provide your translation too as we do not do ad-hoc translation services
for the submitted sentences.

An approved reviewer/contributor will take care of reviewing your submission to
make sure it meets all the criterias from the aforementioned guidelines and, if
all green, will add it to the corpus.

This process should be followed even for submissions that come from already
vetted contributors. Each submission should always have another pair of eyes
(other than the author themselves) to verify that the entry is acceptable. This
is to guarantee a high level of curation and quality of entries. However, given
the early stages of the project and how we still don't know how many
contributors and/or participants we'll have, we can make exceptions as initial
contributors might get overloaded with an unnecessarily large amount of reviews.
In case of an unreviewed submission from a project maintainer, the entry should
be tagged with the "break glass" field so it can be reviewed later.
